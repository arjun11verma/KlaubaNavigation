Contains code used by all anchors. Prefer to have a single codebase for all anchors. Feel free to use the SDCard to store a file about the anchor ID etc. and use it for scheduling or anything else needed.
Plug in the sd card into your computer; create a file named "ID.txt" and enter the id number, e.g. 3. You still need to specify the total number of nodes in the network in the code.
